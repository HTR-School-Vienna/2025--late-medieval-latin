## Expansion
All abbreviations are expanded. Standard Latin forms as found in Lewis and Short Dictionary are preferred. 'e' is preferred over 'ae' and 'oe.''ci' is preferred over 'ti' in cases such as 'nacio,' laudacio,' etc. However, 'ti' is preferred over 'ci' in instances with a preceding 's' (e.g. 'questio'). 'h' is preferred over 'ch' in cases like 'mihi/michi' and 'nihil/nichil.' 'd' is preferred over 't' in abbreviations containing 'd' (such as 'sd' for 'sicud,' as opposed ⁠⁠to 'sicut'). Assimilated forms are preferred (i.e. 'ipono' is transcribed as 'impono') regardless of what was the custom of the scribe as apparent from unabbreviated words. However, 'inpono' is preserved, if it is written in this way in the manuscript. 'Iesus' and 'Christus' are preferred over 'Ihesus' and 'Cristus' when the nomina sacra are expanded; otherwise, unabbreviated spellings are preserved, as usual.


## Spelling and characters
All spellings (including errors) are preserved. All forms of i/I or j/J are expanded as 'i' in the miniscule and 'I' in the majuscule. The e caudata (ę) is preserved. Miniscule u/v is transcribed as 'u' in the miniscule and 'V' in the majuscule. The letter w/W is preserved, besides in cases such as 'wlt/Wlt' and 'wlgus/Wlgus,' which are instead transcribed as 'uult/Vult' and 'uulgus/Vulgus.' The long s is replaced with a standard s. 'ff' in cases where a single f/F is orthographically standard is transcribed as F.

## Punctutation
Interpunctuation is preserved. Allowed values are ‧ ? : / ; !
With the exception of use with numerals, interpunctuation is separated with a blank space on both sides (' ‧ ') Line-breaks are marked with '¬' only when they split a word.

## Numerals
Roman numerals are transcribed in capital letters, with no spaces between numerals and puncti (e.g. '‧IX‧'). If a numeral inside the text is extended by an abbreviation sign, the numeral is spelled out in Latin characters. 

## Segmentation
The transcription is segmented by region and lines.  

## Regions
Only the main text region is transcribed. Supra- or inter-linear additions, extensive corrections, correction signs, marginalia, marginal and interlinear glosses, and page numbers are not considered. To assure the correct order of all text lines on a page, each column has its own text region. When marginal glosses are written in the same script as the main text, they are transcribed in their own text regions. Structural tags will not be used.

## Deviation from the baseline
In the case of insertions or corrections, the base line is extended if those corrections or insertions appear on the same line, otherwise they are omitted. If they are included, the letters affected by the corrections will be marked with ⸍⸍ to show the correction in the transcription. 

Initials are omitted if they span multiple lines; however, if they only span one line, they are included.

Illegible sections are left out by way of diverting the line around it; alternatively, they are marked with the 'corr' or 'unclear' tag. If an illegible section is at the start or the end of a line, the line will start after or end before the illegible section. Blank spaces and holes in the parchment are also omitted by diverting the line around it. If a word is split-up by a hole, the word is likewise divided into two parts, marked with '¬' after the first part.

## Method
The transcription is fully manual, however, editions of the Pulkava Chronicle (FRB Tom. V) and Cosmas of Prague (MGH SS rer. Germ. N. S. 2) are used as reference texts.

## Quality control
There are two discrete stages ensuring quality control. First there is the transcription process itself. Then there is a review of this transcription performed by a different individual than the transcriber.

## Textual tags
There are numerous tags which signify when the text becomes difficult due to the material condition of the manuscript itself or errors of the original scribe: 'blackening,' 'corr,' 'gap,' and 'unclear.'
