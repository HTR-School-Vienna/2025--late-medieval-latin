# Transcription Guidelines

## Expansion

All abbreviations are expanded. Standard Latin forms as found in Lewis and Short Dictionary are preferred.

- `e` is preferred over `ae` and `oe`
- `ci` is preferred over `ti` in cases such as `nacio`, `laudacio`, etc.
- `ti` is preferred over `ci` in instances with a preceding `s` (e.g., `questio`)
- `h` is preferred over `ch` in cases like `mihi/michi` and `nihil/nichil`
- `d` is preferred over `t` in abbreviations containing `d` (e.g., `sd` for `sicud`, as opposed to `sicut`)
- Assimilated forms are preferred (e.g., `ipono` is transcribed as `impono`) regardless of the scribe's usual custom
- `inpono` is preserved if written this way in the manuscript
- `Iesus` and `Christus` are preferred over `Ihesus` and `Cristus` when nomina sacra are expanded; otherwise, unabbreviated spellings are preserved


## Spelling and Characters

All spellings (including errors) are preserved.

- All forms of `i`/`I` or `j`/`J` are expanded as `i` in lowercase and `I` in uppercase
- The e caudata (`ę`) is preserved
- Minuscule `u`/`v` is transcribed as `u` in lowercase and `V` in uppercase
- The letter `w`/`W` is preserved, except in cases like `wlt`/`Wlt` and `wlgus`/`Wlgus`, which are transcribed as `uult`/`Vult` and `uulgus`/`Vulgus`
- The long s is replaced with a standard `s`
- `ff` in cases where a single `f`/`F` is orthographically standard is transcribed as `F`

## Punctuation

Interpunctuation is preserved. Allowed values are: `‧` `?` `:` `/` `;` `!`

With the exception of use with numerals, interpunctuation is separated with a blank space on both sides (e.g., ` ‧ `).

Line-breaks are marked with `¬` only when they split a word.

## Numerals

Roman numerals are transcribed in capital letters, with no spaces between numerals and puncti (e.g., `‧IX‧`). If a numeral inside the text is extended by an abbreviation sign, the numeral is spelled out in Latin characters. 

## Segmentation

The transcription is segmented by region and lines.

## Regions

Only the main text region is transcribed. The following are not considered:

- Supra- or inter-linear additions
- Extensive corrections
- Correction signs
- Marginalia
- Marginal and interlinear glosses
- Page numbers

To ensure the correct order of all text lines on a page, each column has its own text region. When marginal glosses are written in the same script as the main text, they are transcribed in their own text regions. Structural tags are not used.

## Deviation from the Baseline

In the case of insertions or corrections, the base line is extended if those corrections or insertions appear on the same line; otherwise, they are omitted. If they are included, the letters affected by the corrections will be marked with `⸍⸍` to show the correction in the transcription.

Initials are omitted if they span multiple lines; however, if they only span one line, they are included.

Illegible sections are left out by diverting the line around them; alternatively, they are marked with the `corr` or `unclear` tag. If an illegible section is at the start or the end of a line, the line will start after or end before the illegible section. Blank spaces and holes in the parchment are also omitted by diverting the line around them. If a word is split by a hole, the word is likewise divided into two parts, marked with `¬` after the first part.

## Method

The transcription is fully manual. However, editions of the Pulkava Chronicle (FRB Tom. V) and Cosmas of Prague (MGH SS rer. Germ. N. S. 2) are used as reference texts.

## Quality Control

There are two discrete stages ensuring quality control:

1. The transcription process itself
2. A review of the transcription performed by a different individual than the transcriber

## Textual Tags

There are numerous tags which signify when the text becomes difficult due to the material condition of the manuscript itself or errors of the original scribe:

- `blackening`
- `corr`
- `gap`
- `unclear`
